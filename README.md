# Video-Summarization-Using-NLP
Video summarization using Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a pivotal task in multimedia 
content analysis, aiming to condense lengthy video content into concise textual summaries 
while preserving essential information and context. This paper provides an overview of video 
summarization techniques leveraging NLP, highlighting key approaches, challenges, and 
applications in the field. By combining audio and visual analysis with text processing, NLP 
enables the extraction of insights from video content and the generation of coherent summaries 
that capture the main themes and key points
